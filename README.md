# FlashCardsManager-Android
Android app for my FlashCardsManager Desktop application

FlashCardsManager f√ºr Android is a simple tool for learning cards you already created with my desktop application on mobile devices.

## Features:
- [x] Choose by yourself how often you want to repeat questions by choosing the number of stacks in each project individually
- [x] Choose what part of a project to learn: filter cards by category or label
- [x] At the end of a learning session some statistics about your progress are displayed
- [x] Keep track of your progress with a traffic light system and a progress bar
- [x] Import zipped exports from the desktop application or download them directly from an http website
- [x] Create very simple flashcards directly out of the app
- [ ] Edit flashcards directly out of the app
- [ ] Download zipped files via https or from password protected sites (e.g. a private GitLab repository)

## Alpha version available :)
If you wanna become an Alpha Tester, please feel free to contact me via E-Mail:

What I need from you is your Gmail-Address (the one you use for Google PlayStore on your phone) in order to add you to my tester list.

You can **test the app** with my zipped files from my question collection (german). At the moment it makes more sense to create cards with the desktop application, export them, zip them and download or import them from the app. You cannot edit or format cards yet - all coming soon :) .

!! **ATTENTION** please do not save any relevant data in this app, as it is still in an experimental state !!
